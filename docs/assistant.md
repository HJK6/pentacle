# Optional persistent assistant

The assistant is an ordinary top-level session identified by a configured role. It uses the existing chat view, transcripts, reports, questions, spawn reservations and handoff. This option adds no service, database or model router. It is disabled by default.

## Configuration

Set `PENTACLE_ASSISTANT_ROLE=assistant` in the daemon's private environment to protect that role on its local host. Set `features.assistantRole` to the same nonempty slug in each participating desktop/mobile private configuration. Leave these absent or empty for ordinary behavior. Public examples ship without an active assistant role. Restart the daemon after changing its environment and rebuild/reload clients according to their existing configuration workflow. Do not commit personal instructions, machine identities, credentials or context into these public repositories.

Clients pin an exact role match ahead of the normal attention order while retaining its attention indicators. They hide existing delete controls and refuse local deletion attempts. Other sessions retain their existing behavior. A mismatched or disabled client may still show a delete action; the enabled daemon remains authoritative and returns `close_protected`. That error is terminal and must not enter a retry loop.

## Activation and context

Use the existing authenticated operator or trusted service spawn interface to create a top-level session on the daemon host with the configured role, chosen provider/model/effort, and private initial instructions. An ordinary agent token cannot grant or remove the protected role. Operator/service role changes use the existing role-set interface. The role does not confer general orchestration authority.

Private deployments may place an `agents/<role>_baseline.md` in their configured memory root so the existing orchestration CLI prepends it on spawn. The daemon does not invent or manage personal memory. The bootstrap should load a compact private context file and link existing work/receipt records. Record new commitments before acknowledging them, and retain dispatch IDs so a successor checks delivery evidence before retrying. A conversation checkpoint is not evidence that a project completed.

## Continuation and failure

Exactly one assistant holder is admitted, except for the bounded overlap during an existing managed handoff. Concurrent activation and role grants are serialized; unresolved persisted spawn intents also prevent a duplicate activation. Repeating the same spawn request keeps existing idempotent replay semantics.

The current assistant may use its verified token for `spawn --handoff`, preserving the role and staying on the daemon host. Authenticated operator recovery uses the existing spawn handoff fields with the prior stream as `handoff_from_stream_id`. Successful launch uses the existing managed predecessor close. A successor should wait until it is the sole open holder before writing shared context or dispatching work. If cleanup is uncertain, inspect the existing receipt and predecessor instead of starting another replacement.

Ordinary operator, self, idle-reap and sweep closes are protected. Only internal `handed_off` and `spawn_rollback` close kinds bypass protection; a client-supplied `close_kind` cannot authorize deletion. Confirmed pane death leaves the protected row open with death evidence so its existing client entry remains available for recovery. Recovery is explicit; there is no new automatic restart loop. A daemon restart reconstructs the same session and pending-intent state.

Existing owner-authorized scheduled handoffs can provide a future continuation. Assistant authority is checked at schedule admission; internal dispatch uses the scheduler's trusted identity. Track the accepted schedule receipt and keep obsolete wakeups cancelled. A locally hosted model alone does not provide offline phone access.

## Validation

`services/chat-stream-v2/tests/test_assistant_role.py` covers default-off behavior, ordinary close protection, role authority, concurrent activation, idempotent replay, pending intents, managed dead-session handoff, retained recovery entry, scheduled admission and forged managed-close fields. Existing role, handoff and scheduler suites cover their surrounding contracts. Run the daemon merge gate and each client's documented gate before activation. A live provider/installed-client readback remains distinct from deterministic fixture evidence.
