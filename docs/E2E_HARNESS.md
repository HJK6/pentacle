# Public end-to-end validation harness

The public harness is provider-free and uses a disposable local daemon. It validates the shipped websocket and renderer contracts with synthetic sessions; it does not connect to a production service or collect live user content.

## Unit and protocol checks

Run the repository's normal unit gate first:

```bash
python3 services/chat-stream-v2/tools/run_gate.py unit
```

For a websocket smoke check, start a daemon on an ephemeral loopback port with temporary session and notification stores, then exercise `welcome`, `hello`, `list_sessions`, `spawn`, `send`, and `close`. The test should use a fake provider executable that writes deterministic output to a disposable tmux session.

## Renderer walk

The renderer walk may use a browser automation client or a DOM test. Seed one synthetic session, wait for the sidebar row, send a fixed prompt, and assert both the state update and the rendered transcript row. A telemetry counter alone is not render evidence.

Every walk should:

- use a fresh temporary directory;
- use loopback URLs and generated request ids;
- record compact verdict JSON beside the test run;
- clear the directory after the run; and
- fail if a required DOM element is absent or contains unexpected fixture text.

## Evidence contract

Evidence is a small object containing the test name, candidate identifier, timestamps, and pass/fail assertions. Do not paste transcripts, environment dumps, absolute home paths, or tokens into evidence. Synthetic prompts and responses should be short and recognizable, for example `fixture-question` and `fixture-answer`.

Retired provider-specific launchers and live operational evidence are outside this public harness. If a scenario needs a private service, keep it in a local-only test package rather than weakening this contract.
